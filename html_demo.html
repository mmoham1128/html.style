    <h1> Naruto characters </h1>
    <p>Naruto: On the day of his birth, Naruto had the nine tail fox spirit sealed inside him and grew up as an orphan. His dream was to become the hokage and win the hearts of all the villagers.</p>
    <p2>Sakura: Sakura isn't really needed.. </p2>
    <p3>Sasuke: My personal favorite is Sasuke. He is honestly the coolest character in the world of Naruto. Although he turns into a villain, he still has very redeemable qualities and he is extremely powerful.</p3>
